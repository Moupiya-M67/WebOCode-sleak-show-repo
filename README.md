For pictures we used non-copyrighted images from unsplash.com. For filterSelection() we took help from bootstrap. For icons we used fontawesome.com.

We did not utilise any of the pre-made CSS/JS frameworks.

Our Topic was 'Furniture and Home Appliances'. We designed a website to showoff the different products our comapny, Decoir, offers to its customers according to their own likes. We designed the logo ourselves to symbolize our company.

We took a long time figuring how to make our website responsive.

Making a website responsive was definitely something we learned through this competition.
